# Prostate Epithelial Plasma Membranes

Coarse-grained (Martini 2) Molecular Dynamics Production Simulation files for health, benign and metastatic prostate epithelial membranes.

The following systems were simulated:
 - **RWPE1**:  Healthy prostate epithelial membrane
 - **BPH-1**:  Benign hyperplastic prostate epithelial membrane
 - **PC-3**:   Bone metastatic prostate epithelial membrane (with phosphatidylserine symmetry imposed)
 - **LNCaP**:  Lymph node metastatic prostate epithelial membrane (with phosphatidylserine symmetry imposed)
 - **DU145**:  Brain metastatic prostate epithelial membrane (with phosphatidylserine symmetry imposed)

 - **Asym-PC-3**:  Bone metastatic prostate epithelial membrane
 - **Asym-LNCaP**: Lymph node metastatic prostate epithelial membrane
 - **Asym-DU145**: Brain metastatic prostate epithelial membrane
